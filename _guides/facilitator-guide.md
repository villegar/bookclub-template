# FACILITATOR GUIDE

There is no perfect recipe for what makes a bookclub successful and ensuring your group makes it to the finish line, but here's a list of tips from past facilitators who have made it and what worked for them:

Maya Gans (Advanced R)
 - Come with questions! This can be in the form of working through chapter problems together, or questions you have on the chapter, but opening to questions for the group can sometimes yeild in crickets. This is helpful to create a dialog and also sets a precedent showing your own vulnerability so others _will_ be willing to come with questions, no matter how small
 - Urge presenters to apply the concepts rather than reiterate the chapter. It's nice to have a brief overview but if you learn that someone is working on a package or Shiny app that relates to the package you can gently urge them to present (if they don't want to - that's okay!). 
 - Present bugs! It was really fun working through code problems together as they relate to the chapter and in our own work

Kevin Kent (Advanced R)
- Encourage the pratice of talking through code and difficult parts of the reading together. No one is expected to be an expert the first time around and thinking aloud is a really great way to problem-solve together and figure things out. Own the fact that this stuff isn't easy. 
- Make thinking visible as much as you can. That could be talking aloud, diagraming your best understanding of concepts, trying to make connections between different chapters etc. As a facilitator it is helpful to model these practices. 
- Try to decide who the presenters are at least 2 weeks ahead of time. Keeping a little bit of breathing room makes things more forgiving if you forget to ask one week.
- If you have the time, coming up with focus questions before starting a chapter can be helpful for folks who are looking for some direction in their reading. These questions should center around key concepts and could align to the quiz questions that are presented at the beginning of each chapter. 
- Spend some time in the first meeting walking through the process (with screen sharing) of updating the github schedule and uploading content. and direct folks to the resources about github (especially the (video walkthrough)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNUNPkoledI]) from Tan Ho) on the main page.
